			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we really enjoyed going back and debugging a lab that we really struggled on the first time around. Most of our challenges consisted of us trying to remember what code fixes what but other than that!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our main concern was that the text box comes up twice but we left it alone because we figured it wouldnâ€™t be too much of  a distraction or problem for the website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall this lab was super easy and we had a lot of fun really taking our time and making sure we did this lab correctly. We also added some pictures and had fun with writing some fun stuff to say on the website to make it more our style!</p>
