					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge was preserving hope in roadblocks we had in this lab. we would sweep through the code and research different tags, until ultimately we restarted. We ended up asking two seperate groups of people by the perk cafe we were in who knew stuff about CS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a lot of issues; primarily with linking the js file onto the HTML file. It semmed to be working when input into browser javascript console, but our local HTML javascript script output file would come up blank.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was our most challenging lab yet, but we learned a lot about javascript terms, and their requirements and results.</p>
