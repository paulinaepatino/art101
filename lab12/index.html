					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this assignment we had no challenges despite working days after the lecture. We went back and forth on different concepts we wanted to do with this assignment but eventually picked one we thought was really cute!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didnâ€™t face any face problems. We used the canvas assignment as reference and tested out the code in the console first before committing! </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, we really liked being able to explore the different things that can happen within this assignment, we added a butt load of CSS and just had a lot of fun editing the website! </p>
