			<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For the most part this lab was similar to the last one. Our biggest challenge was that we were mostly confused on what the outcome of the lab was supposed to be. We ended up creating our comic and getting it to upload on our webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We attempted task X and werenâ€™t completely sure if we had done it right but we wanted to give it a go, our main problem was not really knowing how to input an image into the "src" in the html, while having an interchangeable "src" to navigate scrolling through the comics.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Because this lab was worth more than the others we wanted to make sure we were going about it correctly, we debugged for a while and went back and forth on Task X to make sure we had given it our all and tried everything we could. We input the previous and next buttons but unfortunately could not get them to work. We tried an IF function by inputting 
						<br>
						if (currentComicNumber < 1) { <br>
							  currentComicNumber = 1;
						
					</br>
						But we still did not get results where we were able to navigate the comics through the buttons.</p>
