			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab our main challenge was getting our output to show up on our webpage. Once that was figured out everything was in place.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our problems were remembering which functions did what. We also both were not able to attend in person class on Tuesday so we had to heavily rely on the notes and recorded lecture. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab took some concentration. We figured it out within a good time compared to some other labs we have struggled with quite a bit. Ultimately we figured it out and liked the output on our webpage!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<button id="myButton">Should I do my homework right now?</button>
