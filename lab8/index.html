			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We did not have asa many challenges this lab, as we worked with the information fresh in our mind, I think what was also helpful was working in section and asking questions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a tiny bit of trouble with identifying the main(), and how we did not need to include it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab was super breezy compared to the lab 7, and we were a bit scared from how we struggled on the last one. </p>
