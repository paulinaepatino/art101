			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to create a refined homepage, and cohesive navigation for the site.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was a bit tricky to insert an image, I refined and corrected small mishaps along the way. It was lots of trial and error and insterting images ended up taking up most of the time. I also had a lopt of trouble linking the homepage to this site (lab3) because I forgort about adding periods to signify parent files. I have now learned from my mistakes...</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was actually pretty simple and easy to understand! My goal was to create something that felt true to me, and determining how I want to introduce my site. I am glad to start having more structure & purpose in my site, and excited to see what other features Iâ€™ll add in upcoming labs.</p>
