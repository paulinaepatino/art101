			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This time around the lab was a bit easier! Our only challenge was picking a game that we both felt we would be abkle to ,make with our skillset. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Putting our javascript code into HTMLK and navigating pseudocode. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Honestly we were a bit nervous to start working with javascript. We prioritized applying what we learned in lecture to not get mixed up with a mistake, or overlook a small detail. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
