					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges we faced for this Lab were definitely being so far away from each other. The last labs we have been working together, side by side and we can see each other's screens which really helps but for this one we couldn’t do that so we did have to set aside some time for each other. We Facetimed and shared screens to mimic what we would do if we were next to each other and got the work done but that was the biggest problem.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest problem we faced was formatting the object and connecting it to the html. We couldn’t get ours to match the screenshot on the canvas assignment but luckily with some trouble shooting we figured it out. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this lab was straightforward, the object part was a little confusing and had us stuck for a bit but after some research we worked through it. We overcame being at a distance, and made sure to keep open communication and updates on progress.</p>
