			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Some challenges we faced were getting the output to appear on our site and getting our button to work. We had worked through these challenges eventually.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The first problem was getting the output to appear so we gave and put javascript code into the html. The next pronlem was getting our button to work correctly so we did have to use chatgbt to help us. We got the button to work by refinig some of our chatgbt requests and reading the code step by step to make sure we didn't miss anything.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this assignment was a little more tricky than others. We had to try to remember what was taught last thursday so working right after class is usually our best bet. We eventually figured it out and worked through our mistakes. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> This button will sort your input alphabetically! </p>
					<div id="output"></div>
